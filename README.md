This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Exercise Instructions
Find attached a JSON file containing data about Newsela's quiz questions. Each question has text and a percent correct value, which is the percent of students who have answered that question correctly. The file should be encoded in UTF-8.

We'd like your analysis of the following question: What words or phrases appear more frequently in questions that students tend to do poorly on, and what appear more frequently in questions that students do well on?

We think this exercise should take about one hour. Please do not spend more than three hours working on it. Include a brief write-up of your solution and results in the body of your reply. You may respond to this email with questions.

Python or JavaScript are fundamental competencies at Newsela. We suggest code be written in one of these languages, but it is not a requirement. Reference any dependencies using a standard format. We should be able to get the code running ourselves.

There's no one right answer here, but there are more or less meaningful results. Well-documented code is a plus but not necessary. Our expectation is that we can follow your thought process. If you get different results using different methods you may include any that you find interesting in your response.

### Hints

It's acceptable to define "questions students did poorly/well on" as questions with percent correct values of less than 50% or greater than 50%, respectively. There may be other approaches or cutoff values that yield different results.

Consider how many appearances of a word there needs to be in order to say something about it. There may be words that should be excluded or sanitized.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
